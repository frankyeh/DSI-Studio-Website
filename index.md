### **DSI Studio: A Lightweight and Adaptive Tractography Tool for Tractography Analysis**  

DSI Studio is a user-friendly tractography software designed for tractography analysis. It allows researchers and clinicians to efficiently map brain connections and explore their relationships with brain disorders.  

Guided by a minimalist design philosophy, DSI Studio prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability:  

- **Straightforward Tractography** â€“ Start with a simple method before considering more advanced approaches.  
- **Minimal Preprocessing** â€“ Uses only essential corrections (e.g., **FSLâ€™s TOPUP and eddy**) to reduce preprocessing burden.  
- **Simple but Effective Modeling** â€“ Uses simple models such as **DTI, GQI, and QSDR**.  
- **Adaptive to Research Needs** â€“ Frequently updated based on user feedback to remain relevant to the research community.  
- **Concept-Driven Innovation** â€“ Introduces novel yet accessible analysis approaches, including:  
  - **Tract-to-region connectome** for connectivity mapping  
  - **Differential tractography** for detecting structural changes  
  - **Correlational tractography** for studying structure-function relationships  

By emphasizing ease of use and conceptual innovations, DSI Studio enables researchers to explore brain connectivity without the complexities of excessive preprocessing or over-engineered modeling. ðŸš€

### Research in Clinical Medicine for Tumor Patients

Under the research projects, DSI Studio has helped more than 200 brain tumor patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center:

Fiber tracking in DSI Studio provides a superior presurgical evaluation of the fiber tracts for patients with complex brain lesions, including low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Presurgical studies are built upon precise and accurate neuroanatomical knowledge, which allows doctors to reconstruct perilesional or intralesional fiber tracts, design the less invasive trajectory into the target lesion and apply more effectively intraoperative electrical mapping techniques for maximal and safe tumor resection in eloquent cortical and subcortical regions. 

Our clinical experience applying DSI Studio fiber tracking has been reported in Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgery, and Neuro-oncology among others. We are actively investigating its potential for not only presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation but also for neurostructural damage assessment, estimation of postsurgical neural pathways damage and recovery, and tracking of postsurgical changes and responses to rehabilitation therapy.

The latest innovation is the reconstruction of cranial nerves for presurgical evaluation in skull base surgery, with very promising results. The ultimate goal is to facilitate brain function preservation and recovery in patients undergoing complex brain surgery.

### Histology Studies

DSI Studio can process high-resolution ex-vivo diffusion "MRI microscopy" acquired at a large volume of imaging data, makes it possible to estimate the location, orientation, and anisotropy of the tracts in any histological specimens. This provides a powerful tool to investigate the structural topology of biological tissue to shade insight into its physiological function.
